# Hello, this is Gio's dotpackages

Think of this like as my dotfiles of npm packages.

## TODOs

- ~~Add tests for all packages~~
  - Maybe some of the tests configs can be packaged as well?
- CI configuration using GitHub Actions
  - Lint
  - Tests
  - Automagically bump versions using semanit-release or similar
  - Generate changelogs
  - Publish on NPM
